Functions
=========

Functions are the internals of subTOM which are implemented in Matlab and
utilizes the TOM toolbox to do the actual processing of subvolumes alignment and
averaging. Each function can be run itself in Matlab, which allows for users to
copy and modify these functions in anyway that they see fit. 

Care has been taken to make sure the functions have at least upper-level
documentation, which can be accessed using the ``help`` command in Matlab, and
is also included here for reference.
