The best way to get started and familiar with subTOM is to jump in and get your
feet wet. The tutorial covers the entire pipeline of using subTOM in getting a
structure of the HIV-1 CA-SP1 assembled in presence of Bevirimat, which can be
downloaded from `EMPIAR-10164`_. We use the same subset of the data that was
used in `Turonova et al`_. 

You can download a PDF version of the :download:`Tutorial
