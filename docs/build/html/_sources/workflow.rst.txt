Example Workflow
================

The best way to learn how to use subTOM is to just start using it. I would
suggest downloading the HIV-1 CA-SP1 publicly available dataset `EMPIAR-10164`_
and using the same subset that was used in `Turonova et al`_. An example
workflow showing which scripts are used when and where is included here as a
sort of guide into what a particular project run of subTOM looks like from start
to finish. Scripts are copied from your subTOM installation directory to your
project directory and edited from the project directory. Then you make the
script executable and run it, again from the project directory.

You can download a PDF version of the workflow: :download:`here
<../subTOM_workflow.pdf>`.
